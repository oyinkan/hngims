                  <p style="font-size: 18px; margin-top:20px;">From running the internship wholly on slack to assigning tasks and grading them, managing the HNG Internship program was a cumbersome task. The management of the program deemed it wise to develop an app that will lighten the burden. HNGIM was born: an app to facilitate easier mentor-mentee integration thereby reducing the challenges that were hitherto faced by both interns and mentors. The app aims at providing a platform for interns to easily access their task, view their progress, see the mentors assigned to them and have ready submission links for any given task. It also makes it easier for mentors to see the interns assigned to them, grade them easily and give much-needed feedback to the interns.

                      <p>I have always wanted to switch careers from Accounting to Software development. I got the perfect opportunity to do so through this internship as it provided an environment for me to work in and practice what I have learned as a self-taught software developer.
                          Initially, learning was difficult and I  was a tad -bit disorganized. That was up until the HNG Internship Manager was introduced. Now, I'm able to track my progress, see where I'm falling short and quickly readjust to make up. I surely would have dropped from the internship but for the timely intervention of HNGIM.

                          Impostor Syndrome has been a challenge to me. I never felt good enough for any job. Getting to join this internship was the saving grace for me as I was able to validate my skills through tasks and I gained my confidence. Wit the HNG Internship Manager, I always got feedback from my mentors. This saved as a shepherds rod, prodding and shoving me along the path until I eventually got to my destination. Today,  I am currently working on a project with two senior software developers and I am at par with them.

                      <p>I had the bad habit of procrastination. I didn't like doing things before time. I always wanted to do things under deadline induced panic. This internship changed that for me. I was kept on my toes knowing that failure was consequent to eviction from the internship. I had a difficult time planning and executing my task. With the introduction of HNG Internship Manager, I now plan and execute tasks assigned to me easily. Meeting deadlines is no longer a problem.
